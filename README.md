Overview:
This code is a file organizer tool designed to simplify the task of managing and organizing downloaded files on your computer. It automates the process of categorizing and placing files into their corresponding folders based on their file extensions.

Features:
  File Extension-Based Organization: The code scans a designated folder (e.g., your Downloads folder) and identifies the file extensions of all the files within it.

  User-Defined Destination Folders: You can specify where you want the files of each extension to be moved. For example, all .jpg files can be moved to a "Images" folder, while .pdf files can be moved to a "Documents" folder.

  Customizable Configuration: The code allows you to define your own rules for organizing files, mapping file extensions to destination folders. This way, you can tailor the organization to your specific needs.

How to Use:
  Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
  
  Install Dependencies: If necessary, install any required dependencies for the script to run. The specific dependencies may vary depending on the programming language you're using.
  
  Configure the Organizer: Open the code and configure the settings. Define the source folder (e.g., Downloads) and the mapping of file extensions to destination folders as needed.
  
  Run the Code: Execute the script, and it will automatically organize your files based on your predefined rules.
  
  Review the Results: Check the destination folders to ensure your files have been organized correctly.
